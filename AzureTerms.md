- Regions
- Region Pairs - Each Azure region is paired with another region. Azure prefers at least 300 miles of seperation. Services provide automatic replication to the paired region. System updates are rolled out to region pairs sequentially, not at the same time 
- Avaliability Zones
- Resource Groups - A collection of resources. Every resource must exist in one (and only one!) resource group. The resources can be from multiple region. Deleting a resource group deletes all resources in that group. Use Locks to prevent this
- Subscriptions
- Management Groups - Helps you manage access, policy, compliance and more for multiple subscriptions. Alll subscriptions in a Management Group inherit conditions applied to the MG, and 10,000 MG can be supported in a single directory. Hierarchy is: Management group > Subscriptions > Resource Groups > Resources
